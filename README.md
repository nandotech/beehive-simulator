# beehive-simulator

Windows Forms App

Code written for Head First C# (2nd Edition) book a long time ago.  One of the final projects is creating a beehive simulator that has some user interaction, but mostly runs tasks in the background while updating the UI in real-time.

Pretty interesting to look over the algorithms and watch the UI update based on the tasks.

Allows pausing & resuming, also resetting to initial variables.  UX/UI could be changed to accept input values rather than being static.
